      <description>Educators Features for Educators Choosing the right materials for your students can be an arduous task. This is especially true when determining whether these learning materials are too difficult to read. With Readability Studio, you can determine the reading level of your materials, as well as guidance to make them easier to read.
Tests are also available for determining which materials are a good fit for second-language students. Dolch sight words and the McAlpine EFLAWÂ® test are provided for both young English and ESL (English as a Second Language) readers.</description>
